# Fire
This is a personal project I'm using to learn how to use the Django framework.

# Information about the programming side

Django Framework (python) based social network site.

### WIP
 - I intend to iterate over page designs to improve as I develop the back-end
 - I am developing the back-end alongside of the front-end in order to keep the design relevant to the purpose of the page
 
## Page Design Style
 - I've chosen to revolve around flames/fire as the style of the design
 - The current liking system is not working, though I am likely going to implement a 'fuel' or 'water' system
 
## Database
 - Site does include fully working login/signup system w/ user database & posts database linked
 - Currently using an SQLite db which is not for production due to limitations, will likely switch to something else in the future

Versions used:

- Bootstrap 4.1
- Django 3.0.2

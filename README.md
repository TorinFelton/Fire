# Fire
Django Framework (python) based social network site.

### WIP
 - I intend to iterate over page designs to improve as I develop the back-end
 - I am developing the back-end alongside of the front-end in order to keep the design relevant to the purpose of the page

Versions used:

- Bootstrap 4.1
- Django 3.0.2

# Screenshots
## Most of these may be updated over time.
